•	Campus Layout: All divisions (Elementary, Middle, High School, plus the Early Years Center) share one large campus, enabling a unified community feel. However, each division has its own building/section designed for its age group, to create appropriately scaled environments. In total there are six main buildings:
•	The Early Childhood Center (ECC): A secure area tailored to little ones, with small toilets, low sinks, cozy reading corners, nap areas, and a dedicated ECC playground – all designed for ages 3–5.
•	The Elementary School building: Houses Kindergarten through Grade 5. It includes colorful classrooms, the Sabina Brady Elementary Library, an elementary art atrium, science discovery rooms, a dedicated elementary music room, and a child-sized gymnasium so younger students have their own sports space.
•	The Middle School building: Contains Grades 6–8 classrooms, plus special facilities like the Red Scroll Library (Middle School library), a design lab known as “The Hub” (with makerspace equipment for MS projects), science labs, a media studio for video production, and the “Gallerie” hallway where student artwork is showcased. Middle Schoolers also have their own outdoor play area and garden for recess and science projects.
•	The High School building: A modern facility (newly expanded/renovated in the mid-2010s) for Grades 9–12. It features the Green Sky Learning Commons (High School library) that resembles a college library with extensive print and digital resources, individual and group study areas, and even a cafe-style seating zone. The HS building also has state-of-the-art science labs (for biology, chemistry, physics), design and engineering workshops (with high-end equipment like 3D printers and laser cutters), computer labs, art studios, and Wild Ginger – a cafeteria/commons that serves as a dining hall and social study space. High schoolers also enjoy senior lounges and open-plan “collaboration spaces” throughout the building.
•	Performing Arts Center (PAC): A shared facility that includes the largest theater (the Founders’ Theatre with professional stage, lighting, and seating for large audiences), plus smaller theaters like the Blue Box Theatre and “Out-of-the-Box” Theatre for intimate performances or experimental productions. The PAC also houses dedicated music classrooms, practice rooms, recording studios, and dance studios with sprung floors and mirrors. These cater to WAB’s extensive music and drama programs.
•	Sports Facilities: Spread across the campus, athletics facilities are truly world-class. There are multiple indoor gymnasiums – one attached to each division for PE classes, and larger ones for competitions (one MS/HS gym even has a rock climbing wall). WAB has a 25-meter indoor swimming pool (6 lanes, used for PE swimming units, swim team practices, and community lap swim). Outdoors, the crown jewel is Tiger Field, a large turf field used for soccer, rugby, track and field (there’s a 400m track oval), etc. For all-season training, WAB has the Tiger L’Air Dome, an inflatable dome that can be placed over an outdoor court or field in winter – allowing tennis, soccer, or other sports to continue during Beijing’s cold months. There are also outdoor tennis courts, a basketball courtyard, and the Adrenaline Fitness Center (a fully equipped fitness/weight room available to students and staff for strength and cardio training).
•	Facility Highlights:
•	Air Quality Systems: Recognizing Beijing’s air pollution challenges, WAB has invested heavily in keeping indoor air clean. The entire campus has a central air filtration system. Every classroom and indoor space is outfitted with industrial-grade air purifiers and real-time AQI monitors. During pollution episodes, WAB can often maintain indoor air quality under AQI 5, which is extremely clean. The school also has protocols like “indoor recess” on very polluted days to keep kids safe, but thanks to the filtration, PE classes can continue in the gyms even if outdoor air is bad. WAB was one of the first schools in Beijing to implement such comprehensive air filtration, showing its commitment to student health.
•	Libraries: WAB has three main libraries (one per division, plus the specialized corners like an ECC library nook) that collectively offer over 60,000 books in at least 15 languages. They also provide extensive e-books, databases, and online research tools. Each library is designed to be inviting: the Elementary library has comfy reading nooks and child-friendly décor; the Middle School library has collaboration tables and a quiet reading zone; the High School library feels like a modern bookstore/cafe with different seating options for group and independent study. Professional librarians run programs like reading challenges, author visits, and research skills workshops (e.g., the HS librarians teach how to cite sources for the Extended Essay). The libraries often host events – for example, a Pajama Night for younger students (organized with Parent Link’s Friends of the Library) or extended evening hours for HS during DP exam season.
•	Science & Innovation Labs: WAB is stocked with cutting-edge labs. The science labs in MS and HS have all the modern apparatus for chemistry titrations, physics experiments (timing gates, circuit equipment, etc.), and biology dissections and microscopy. There are prep rooms and safety systems (fume hoods, emergency showers) for serious lab work. The Design & Makerspaces are exceptional too: they contain 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, robotics kits (like VEX or LEGO Mindstorms), Arduino and Raspberry Pi sets for electronics projects, woodworking tools, and crafting spaces. Students in design classes or clubs can prototype almost anything – from a laser-cut architectural model to a coded Arduino-controlled greenhouse. There’s also a Green Screen studio for filmmaking and a dedicated photography darkroom for analog photo classes (one of the few schools to still teach darkroom techniques alongside digital).
•	Arts Facilities: The visual arts studios are spacious with lots of natural light. There are rooms specialized for painting/drawing, a ceramics studio with wheels and kilns, and digital arts labs with high-performance iMacs for graphic design. The performing arts wing features multiple music ensemble rooms (band room, choir room, each soundproofed and equipped with percussion, pianos, amps, etc.), dozens of small practice rooms for individual instrument practice (some with pianos for lessons), and recording studios for music technology classes or the podcast club. The dance studio has sprung wood floors, mirrored walls, and a sound system. The theaters, as mentioned, are industry-level – the main Founders’ Theatre has a large stage with fly rigging, professional lighting rigs, and seating for several hundred; perfect for all-school assemblies or the HS musical. The smaller theaters allow flexibility for varied productions or student-run shows. These facilities mean students can produce high-caliber art, music, and drama – e.g., WAB’s annual musical uses Broadway-grade light and sound equipment, giving students an unparalleled experience.
•	Safety and Security: The campus is a secure gated compound with 24/7 security guards. There are two main entrances (Main Gate and West Gate) where guards check IDs. All visitors must sign in and wear a badge; all students and staff wear ID cards. Despite tight security, the campus feels open and welcoming like a college campus rather than a locked-down facility. The school employs a full-time Campus Safety team that conducts regular drills (fire, earthquake, lockdown drills happen routinely). Additionally, each building has a nurse’s clinic with a qualified nurse to handle medical needs or emergencies. Health and safety are top priorities – during times like the COVID-19 pandemic, WAB was quick to implement temperature checks, health surveys, and hybrid learning as needed, showcasing its preparedness.
•	Campus Design and Aesthetics: WAB’s facilities are not only functional but thoughtfully designed to be conducive to learning. In 2018–2020, WAB undertook a Campus Re-design Project in partnership with Rosan Bosch Studio (a renowned learning space design firm). This project transformed many classrooms and common areas into “flexible learning hubs.” For example, traditional static classrooms were upgraded with movable walls, varied seating options (high stools, floor cushions, standing desks, etc.), and breakout niches where small groups can work. The idea is to support differentiated instruction and student agency in how/where they learn. The Link Bridge connecting Middle and High School was redesigned into an open collaboration atrium with writable surfaces and cozy pods. These modern spaces reflect WAB’s Future of Education Now (FOEN) strategy – ensuring the physical environment keeps up with pedagogical innovation. The campus mixes high-tech modernity with nature; students can just as easily study by the pond as they can in a high-tech lab, which is a balance many newcomers admire.
•	Technology Infrastructure: Beyond student devices and classroom tech, WAB’s IT backbone is robust. The entire campus has high-speed wired and wireless internet coverage; even large common spaces and outdoor courtyards have Wi-Fi so learning can happen anywhere. There are multiple servers and backups to ensure smooth digital operations (and data security for things like the student information system). Classrooms have Apple TVs or wireless display systems to allow any student or teacher device to project to screens seamlessly. The school’s IT Department runs two helpdesk centers (one in the MS/HS area, one in ES) modeled after the Apple Genius Bar concept – students and staff can drop by for any tech help or repairs. Uniquely, WAB has Apple-certified repair technicians on site, so if a student’s MacBook breaks, it can often be fixed right at school. This minimizes downtime. The IT team also provides tech orientation to new families (setting up email, the school apps, etc.) even before they arrive in Beijing. In terms of software, WAB uses a suite of platforms: e.g., Seesaw or similar for elementary e-portfolios, PowerSchool and Microsoft Teams/OneNote in secondary for grading and assignments, and many specialized apps per subject (like math drill programs, coding environments, etc.). Students are taught not just how to use tools, but also principles of digital citizenship and online safety (often in advisory and IT classes). Every year, students and parents sign an Acceptable Use Policy acknowledging tech use expectations. The network has appropriate content filters to block malicious or inappropriate material, and there are regular sessions for parents on managing kids’ digital lives (for example, Parent Link has hosted expert talks on social media and screen time).
•	Recent Upgrades: WAB is continually updating its campus. By 2025, the school installed a significant number of solar panels on two building rooftops as part of its sustainability initiative – now about 15 percent of campus energy is solar-generated, and there are student-run energy monitoring projects connected to this. In 2024, WAB completed a renovation of the Middle School science labs, celebrated with a Science Showcase event highlighting the new cutting-edge equipment. The school is also a beta tester for some ed-tech: for instance, WAB recently transitioned to a new learning management platform for the Middle Years that has built-in AI support for teachers (in 2025 they piloted “Toddle” for MYP, which teachers praised for its flexibility and feedback features). All these upgrades are guided by WAB’s strategic plan to remain at the forefront of educational environments.
•	Campus Atmosphere: Visitors often remark that WAB’s campus feels like an inspiring place to be. It’s vibrant and student-centered – you’ll see student art installations along pathways, flags of many nations flying, and students collaborating in breakout spaces. During passing periods, older students mingle in the commons or by the cafeteria coffee bar working on group projects. Younger kids might be out in the garden for a science observation or reading under a tree. There’s a balance of bustling activity and areas of calm reflection (like the small Peace Park garden). A visiting accreditor once said WAB’s facilities are “on par with the finest international schools in the world”, but more importantly, it’s how those facilities are utilized – in flexible, innovative ways – that makes WAB special. The design and resources are impressive, but they ultimately serve the learning. New students and teachers quickly sense the “wow” factor of the campus, yet over time it simply becomes a comfortable second home where they have everything they need to explore, create, and learn.
