•	PYP Curriculum: The Elementary School continues the IB Primary Years Programme. Learning is organized into 6–8 Units of Inquiry per year, each an interdisciplinary theme. For example, a Grade 2 unit on “Community” might combine social studies (community roles), math (mapping a neighborhood), and language arts (stories about community helpers). Students learn by asking questions and doing hands-on projects guided by these unit themes. This inquiry approach helps them make connections across subjects from an early age.
•	Skill Building: Strong foundations in literacy and numeracy are a priority. WAB uses best-practice programs for reading and writing (inspired by the Readers’ and Writers’ Workshop model), focusing on comprehension, expression, and a love of reading. In math, a conceptual curriculum (influenced by global standards like Australia’s ACARA) emphasizes problem-solving and understanding over rote memorization. Students learn to think critically in math through real-life scenarios.
•	Specialist Classes: Elementary students enjoy classes taught by subject specialists to enrich the core curriculum. All students take Mandarin Chinese language classes multiple times a week (with instruction differentiated for beginners up to native speakers). They also have specialist-led Art, Music, Physical Education, and Library/Media classes. Facilities include dedicated elementary art studios, music rooms, and the Sabina Brady Elementary Library stocked with tens of thousands of children’s books. Starting in Grade 2, students can participate in ensembles like strings orchestra or choir, nurturing creativity from a young age.
•	Technology Integration: Technology is used in a balanced, age-appropriate way. From Kindergarten onward, WAB runs a 1:1 iPad program – each child in K–5 has access to an iPad as a learning tool (in Early Years, iPads are shared; from Grade 1 up, each student has their own school-provided iPad). iPads are used to enhance learning (e.g. creating digital storybooks, practicing math with educational apps) but not to replace hands-on activities. By upper elementary, students also learn basic coding, digital citizenship, and how to use collaborative tools, guided by WAB’s Educational Technology coaches.
•	Inclusive Support: The elementary years have robust support systems. English as an Additional Language (EAL) specialists work with non-native English speakers to help them access the curriculum fully. Learning Support teachers and counselors collaborate with classroom teachers to differentiate instruction for students who have mild learning needs or need extra challenges. This ensures every child can succeed according to their abilities – reflecting WAB’s inclusive philosophy that each child can thrive with the right support.
•	Experiential Learning: Learning often extends beyond the classroom. Students take field trips around Beijing linked to their units (e.g., visiting the Great Wall during a history unit, or a local market for a math/practical life unit on money). On campus, events like International Day, Arts Celebrations, and the Grade 5 PYP Exhibition provide additional hands-on learning. (The Grade 5 Exhibition is a capstone project where students independently research a real-world issue and present their solutions.) Through these experiences, elementary students build confidence, presentation skills, and cultural awareness early on.
