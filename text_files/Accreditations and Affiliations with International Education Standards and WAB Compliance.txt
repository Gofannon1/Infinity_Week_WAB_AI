•	IB World School: WAB is an authorized International Baccalaureate World School, offering the full IB continuum – the Primary Years Programme (PYP), Middle Years Programme (MYP), and Diploma Programme (DP). It has been an IB school since the late 1990s and adheres to IB’s rigorous global standards in curriculum and instruction. (All WAB students follow IB curricula in the appropriate grade ranges.)
•	CIS Accreditation: Fully accredited by the Council of International Schools (CIS), reflecting compliance with high standards in governance, teaching, and student support. In its most recent evaluation, CIS commended WAB as “a remarkable school…with purpose-built facilities…on par with the finest international schools in the world,” providing a “vital, stimulating and challenging education.”
•	NEASC Accreditation: Accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) through its Commission on International Education. This provides an American/international stamp of quality. WAB’s High School Diploma is recognized by U.S. colleges thanks to NEASC accreditation. (WAB undergoes regular re-accreditation cycles and remains in good standing.)
•	Chinese Government License: WAB is licensed by China’s Ministry of Education as an international school for children of foreign nationals. It was among the first schools in Beijing to receive this authorization in the 1990s. (By law, WAB generally cannot enroll PRC citizens without foreign passports – it primarily serves expatriate families in line with government regulations.) WAB’s cooperation with Chinese authorities ensures it operates legally and with host country support.
•	Regional Associations: WAB is a leading member of regional school associations, enabling collaboration, student exchanges, and professional development:
•	EARCOS: East Asia Regional Council of Schools – WAB participates in EARCOS conferences and initiatives with other international schools across East Asia.
•	ACAMIS: Association of China and Mongolia International Schools – WAB connects and competes with peer schools in the North Asia region (academics, sports, arts exchanges). WAB has hosted ACAMIS sports tournaments and cultural conventions.
•	ECIS: Educational Collaborative for International Schools – WAB is a member and even serves as an ECIS Professional Learning Hub in Beijing, often hosting teacher workshops for the region.
•	Activities Conferences: WAB is one of the few Asia-Pacific schools invited to the APAC (Asia Pacific Activities Conference) league – a prestigious consortium for international school sports and arts competitions. It is also a founding member of local athletics leagues such as ISAC (International Schools Athletic Conference) Beijing-Tianjin and participates in the China Cup and Tri-Cities tournaments. These memberships give WAB students opportunities to compete and collaborate widely.
•	Other Affiliations: WAB is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) and international college counseling groups (NACAC, IACAC), keeping it connected to global best practices. It is also a College Board member (with an official SAT/ACT test center on campus for student convenience). WAB partners with educational innovators – for example, it was a pilot school for Harvard Project Zero initiatives and collaborates with organizations like KingLead (a Chinese education think-tank that in 2021–2025 ranked WAB #1 in innovation).
•	Summary: These accreditations and affiliations testify to WAB’s high quality and global engagement. Inspectors and visiting teams consistently praise WAB’s innovative teaching, inclusive culture, and excellent learning outcomes. As a non-profit school, WAB reinvests all resources into improving programs and facilities, further reinforced by these external validations.
