•	Grades 9–10 Curriculum: Students in Grades 9–10 continue with the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) (these are MYP Years 4 and 5). They take a broad range of courses across all major disciplines to ensure a strong foundation in English, languages, humanities, sciences, math, arts, and PE. There is some choice to tailor interests – for instance, a student may choose which additional language to study (Chinese, French, or Spanish) or select an arts elective (such as visual art, music, dance, theatre, or film). In Grade 10, all students complete the Personal Project as the capstone of the MYP, presenting it to the community at a showcase event (parents are often amazed by the passion and sophistication of these projects). The Personal Project experience in Grade 10 acts as a bridge, preparing students for the kind of independent, self-directed work required in Grades 11–12.
•	Grades 11–12 Pathways: In the last two years of high school, all students earn the WAB High School Diploma (a US-accredited diploma), and they choose one of three academic pathways to do so. WAB recognizes different student interests by offering:
1.	IB Diploma Programme (IB DP): ~90 percent of WAB students opt to pursue the full IB Diploma. This is a two-year program in Grades 11–12 where students take six IB subjects (usually 3 at Higher Level and 3 at Standard Level) across the required disciplines: Language & Literature, Language Acquisition, Individuals & Societies, Sciences, Mathematics, and The Arts (or an extra elective instead of Arts). They also complete the IB core requirements: Theory of Knowledge (an interdisciplinary critical thinking course), the 4,000-word Extended Essay (independent research paper), and CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service) experiences. WAB has an open enrollment philosophy for the IB DP – any student willing to take on the challenge is allowed to attempt it (the school does not “weed out” students). Comprehensive support is provided, like extra tutorials and an IB skills course, to help all IB Diploma candidates manage the workload. Results: WAB’s IB Diploma outcomes are excellent. For example, in 2024 the average DP score was 33 points (out of 45), about 3 points above the world average (~30), and 93 percent of WAB’s DP candidates earned the full diploma. Many students also earn Bilingual IB Diplomas (20+ graduates each year, reflecting fluency in English plus Chinese or another mother-tongue).
2.	WAB Capstone Program: A signature WAB-designed pathway for students who do not wish to do the full IB Diploma. The Capstone is a selective, self-designed academic and experiential program. Interested Grade 10 students apply for Capstone, and those admitted spend Grades 11–12 working on an individualized curriculum. A Capstone student typically takes a mix of some IB courses and WAB-designed courses, but devotes a significant portion of time to a major interdisciplinary project of their own design, an internship or off-campus experience, and a research portfolio/paper. Essentially, Capstone students “design their own inquiry” in a field they are passionate about (e.g. sustainable engineering, global business, art therapy, etc.) under mentorship from faculty. They still earn the standard WAB High School Diploma (and may sit for a few IB subject exams as suited to their program), but they are not full IB Diploma candidates. This program is ideal for self-driven students with a clear passion or those who thrive with a more flexible structure. It allows for deep exploration of a specialization while still meeting graduation requirements.
3.	Individualized Course Program: Some students choose a blended course track without committing to IB Diploma or Capstone. These students take a tailored selection of courses to suit their needs – which can include IB Courses (Certificates) in specific subjects of strength, combined with WAB’s own high school courses. For example, a student might take IB Math and IB Art, but not do the full DP, instead also taking some non-IB electives offered by WAB or online courses. WAB offers a few non-IB “core” courses (particularly if a student needs an alternative to an IB class), and also partners with programs like Global Online Academy (GOA) to allow students to take online courses not offered locally (expanding options in niche subjects). This pathway is typically for students who want a lighter workload or a very specialized focus. All students in this track still must meet WAB’s credit requirements for the diploma.
•	Graduation Requirements: To earn the WAB High School Diploma (College Preparatory), students must accumulate a minimum of 24 credits over four years in required areas (English, Math, Science, Social Studies, World Language, Arts, PE/Health, etc.). The vast majority of WAB students meet or exceed these to earn a college-prep diploma. WAB also has a smaller General Studies Diploma option (minimum ~14 credits) reserved for special cases (e.g. transfers or unique circumstances), though this is rarely used. Notably, Service Learning (CAS) is a graduation requirement for all students – even those not in the IB Diploma Programme must engage in community service and global citizenship projects as part of WAB’s emphasis on holistic education.
•	Teaching & Learning in HS: Classes in high school are taught by highly qualified faculty (many are IB Examiners or hold advanced degrees). The atmosphere is often described as “college-like” – students call teachers by their first names, there’s a block schedule with 70-minute periods (allowing in-depth labs and seminars), and students have open periods to study in common areas. Standards-Based Assessment: WAB High School does not calculate GPAs or class rankings. Instead, assessment is criteria-based (as per IB standards) and feedback-rich. In Grade 12, the school creates University Application Grades (UAGs) – an internal grade that predicts IB performance – to assist with college applications in lieu of a GPA. The focus is on learning, not class rank, which encourages collaboration over competition.
•	Support & Enrichment: High school students are supported by a dedicated team: each grade has a Grade Level Leader and counselor, and there is a College Counseling Office that works individually with students from Grade 10/11 onward (see Alumni & College section for more). Learning Support and EAL specialists continue to assist students with learning differences or English needs in high school, through tutoring, a Learning Support Center, and in-class support. For students seeking extra challenge, opportunities like independent studies or additional online courses are available. WAB also encourages real-world exposure via the World of Work program (facilitating internships/job shadowing for students) and other mentorships. By graduation, WAB students are not only well-prepared academically, but have also developed independence, time-management, and self-advocacy skills.
•	High School Culture: The high school division is energetic and diverse. School spirit is strong (WAB’s mascot is the Tiger, and students rally around “Tiger Pride”). Students often design and lead clubs and events. There is a strong sense of community – e.g. a House system or spirit days across grades build camaraderie, and many HS students mentor younger students (through tutoring programs or event volunteering), reinforcing the family feel of WAB.
