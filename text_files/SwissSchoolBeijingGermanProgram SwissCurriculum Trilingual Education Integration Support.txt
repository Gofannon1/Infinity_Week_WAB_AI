•	Overview: Uniquely, WAB hosts the Swiss School Beijing (SSB), the first and only Swiss curriculum program in China. Established in 2017 as a “school within a school” in collaboration with the local Swiss community and Swiss government, SSB operates as a German-language section of WAB. It follows the Swiss curriculum (based on the Canton of Zug framework) to serve expatriate Swiss, German, Austrian, and other German-speaking students in Beijing.
•	Program Details: SSB currently offers classes from Early Years through middle school grades, and plans to eventually extend through Grade 12. All core academic instruction is delivered in German, following Swiss educational standards and methods, ensuring students can transition smoothly back to Swiss/German schools or universities. English and Chinese are also part of the SSB program as additional languages, taught at levels appropriate for SSB students.
•	Integration with WAB: SSB students and teachers are fully part of the WAB community. SSB classes have their own homerooms and follow their curriculum, but they share WAB’s campus facilities (libraries, arts studios, labs, sports venues) and participate in many WAB-wide activities and events. For example, SSB students join WAB’s arts programs, sports teams (where applicable), field trips, and after-school clubs, interacting closely with English-track students. This model allows SSB students to experience a truly international environment while maintaining their mother-tongue education.
•	Support and Significance: The SSB is supported by the Swiss government/Swiss Overseas Schools organization and is a point of pride as an innovative partnership. It exemplifies WAB’s commitment to multilingual, multicultural education – WAB is able to offer a distinct pathway for German-speaking families, something very rare in Asia. SSB’s success has been highlighted in international education circles as a win-win: German-speaking expats get a high-quality home-curriculum education for their children, and WAB’s community is enriched by greater diversity. (Notably, many SSB students also graduate fluent in English and competent in Chinese, alongside German – a truly trilingual outcome.)
