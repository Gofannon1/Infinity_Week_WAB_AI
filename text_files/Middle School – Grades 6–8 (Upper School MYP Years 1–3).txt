•	Middle Years Programme (MYP): WAB Middle School follows the IB Middle Years Programme curriculum (Grades 6–10 are considered the MYP years, though Grades 9–10 are administratively part of high school). All students study across 8 subject groups: Language & Literature (English), Individuals & Societies, Mathematics, Sciences, Language Acquisition (additional languages), Arts, Design, and Physical & Health Education. Learning remains inquiry-based and often interdisciplinary. For example, a science unit might integrate design technology – students could build weather instruments in Design class while studying climate in Science. The MYP framework ensures a well-rounded education and teaches skills like critical thinking and reflection through all subjects.
•	Exploratory Courses: Middle schoolers are encouraged to try new things. The Middle School offers exploratory electives and clubs during the school day for students to pursue interests such as robotics, drama production, yearbook, coding, community service projects, etc. This aligns with WAB’s holistic approach to learning by balancing academics with creative and social opportunities. Additionally, formal Design/Tech classes begin in Middle School: students work in WAB’s design labs on projects involving coding, woodworking, graphic design, and more, building key problem-solving skills.
•	Advisory & Pastoral Care: Every Middle School student is part of a homeroom/advisory group led by a teacher mentor. In this small group setting, students receive social-emotional guidance and life skills education. The advisory program covers topics like friendship, time management, digital citizenship, and puberty/health, helping to support students’ well-being during early adolescence. WAB Middle School is known for a particularly inclusive and supportive environment – students often say “everyone is helpful and you feel accepted.” Advisors, counselors, and teachers work as a team to ensure each student is cared for.
•	“Day 9” Innovation: A unique feature of WAB Middle School is Day 9 – an occasional break from the regular timetable (for example, every few weeks) where students engage in special cross-curricular projects or passion projects. On a Day 9, normal classes pause and instead students might collaborate on a STEM design challenge, participate in a whole-grade community service day, or dive into a cultural workshop. These days spark creativity and allow deep dives into topics beyond the standard curriculum. Middle Schoolers also take annual China trips (usually one week each year) focused on cultural immersion and outdoor adventure – e.g., Grade 6 might go to Inner Mongolia to study grassland ecology, Grade 7 to rural villages for community service, Grade 8 to the mountains for team-building. These overnight trips build resilience, independence, and class camaraderie.
•	Transition to High School: WAB takes care to prepare Grade 8 students for the move to high school (Grades 9–12). Counselors and teachers lead transition activities, including course selection guidance and introductory high school experiences. Notably, as part of the IB continuum, students in Grade 10 (their second year of high school, but the final year of MYP) must complete the MYP Personal Project, a major independent research/project on a topic of their choice. Middle School years deliberately build the research and self-management skills needed so that when students reach Grade 10, they can succeed in the Personal Project. By the end of Grade 8, WAB students are well-prepared academically and personally for the greater rigor and responsibility of high school.
