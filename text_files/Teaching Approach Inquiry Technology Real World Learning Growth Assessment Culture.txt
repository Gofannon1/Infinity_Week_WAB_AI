•	Inquiry-Based Learning: Across all grade levels, WAB emphasizes inquiry and exploration. Rather than rote memorization, students are encouraged to ask questions, investigate problems, and construct their own understanding. Classrooms are active environments where students might be debating ideas, doing experiments, or collaborating on projects. Teachers act as facilitators or coaches, guiding students to find answers and reflect on their learning process. This approach builds critical thinking and independence as students learn how to learn, not just facts.
•	Interdisciplinary Projects: WAB deliberately breaks down traditional subject silos to show the interconnectedness of knowledge. There are many interdisciplinary learning opportunities. For example, in Middle School an Interdisciplinary Unit might have science, art, and design classes team up to address an environmental issue (science to understand it, art to communicate it, design to engineer a solution). In High School, special projects like the “Global Citizenship Project” or “China Engagement Project” require students to apply skills from multiple subjects to plan community service initiatives or research Chinese culture in depth. Even at the daily level, teachers coordinate so that concepts taught in one class link to another. This not only reinforces learning but also keeps students engaged by showing real-world applications.
•	Use of Technology: WAB is at the forefront of educational technology integration. Technology is used not as a gimmick, but as a tool to enhance learning outcomes. All classrooms are equipped with interactive projectors or flat-panel displays, and students from Grade 1 upward have 1:1 devices (iPads in elementary, MacBook laptops in secondary). The curriculum includes digital literacy, coding (e.g. using LEGO Robotics kits in Middle School or coding projects in math class), and media production. For instance, a Grade 8 math class might incorporate programming by having students code robots to navigate a maze, integrating math and design skills. In high school, students use industry-standard software (like Adobe Creative Cloud in art/design, or data analysis tools in science). WAB has even pioneered emerging tech in the classroom: some classes use Virtual Reality (VR) for virtual science labs or virtual field trips, and Artificial Intelligence tools are being piloted under teacher supervision (e.g. a student might use an AI chatbot to practice French conversation or to get feedback on an essay outline, with clear guidelines in place). Importantly, WAB teaches digital citizenship alongside tech skills – students learn about safe and ethical use of technology, how to evaluate online information, and the impact of their digital footprint. (All students and parents sign an Acceptable Use Policy each year.) WAB’s forward-thinking integration of tech — recognized by its Apple Distinguished School status — ensures students are adept at using modern tools and understand when and how to use them appropriately.
•	Authentic, Real-World Learning: A hallmark of WAB’s philosophy is that learning should connect to real life and serve a purpose beyond school. The school strives to give students opportunities to tackle real-world challenges and engage with the community. Examples abound: Middle School science classes culminate in a Science Showcase where student projects address real environmental or engineering questions. The business club runs a “Tiger Trade” initiative where students launch small enterprises on campus and donate profits to charity (learning entrepreneurship and ethics). Many students participate in Model United Nations conferences, debating global issues with peers worldwide. High School’s World of Work program arranges internships at local companies, hospitals, NGOs, etc. Beijing’s location is leveraged – classes take trips to museums, tech companies, cultural sites, and invite external experts (artists, scientists, entrepreneurs) as guest speakers or mentors. By connecting learning to life, WAB not only keeps students motivated, it also fulfills the “Make a Difference” part of its mission by having students work on projects that have impact.
•	Reflection and Growth Mindset: WAB embeds a culture of reflection for both students and teachers. Students frequently engage in self-reflection on their work – for example, after a project or assessment, they might write about what they learned, what they found challenging, and how they can improve. This builds a growth mindset, where students see effort and mistakes as part of learning rather than fixed success/failure. Teachers likewise model lifelong learning – many are action-researchers and tweak their approaches based on student feedback and new pedagogical research. The school encourages trying new ideas (“iteration”) and views innovative failures as learning opportunities. This supportive environment means students aren’t afraid to challenge themselves.
•	Assessment Philosophy: In line with IB principles, WAB uses criterion-referenced assessment. This means students are evaluated against defined objective criteria for each task (e.g. specific rubrics in IB subjects), instead of being compared to each other on a curve. The emphasis is on constructive feedback: teachers give qualitative comments highlighting strengths and suggesting improvements. There are no class ranks or publicly posted GPAs – achievement is seen as personal progress. Even during unusual situations (like periods of online learning during COVID), WAB adapted assessments to be fair and supportive (for example, temporarily using Pass/Incomplete grades or adjusting deadlines to account for stress). This assessment approach reduces unhealthy competition and fosters collaboration – students are encouraged to help each other since one’s success doesn’t diminish another’s.
•	Summary: WAB’s academic approach is rigorous yet flexible. It combines the challenging IB curriculum and high expectations with a progressive, student-centered delivery. Students are given voice and choice in their learning, whether that’s picking a Personal Project topic or choosing which club to lead. The motto “Connect, Inspire, Challenge, Make a Difference” is deeply woven into academics – students connect subjects, are inspired to pursue their passions, are challenged to think deeply, and apply their learning to make a difference beyond the classroom. The result: WAB graduates are not just well-prepared for college; they are innovative thinkers, caring global citizens, and confident lifelong learners.
