•	Eligibility: In line with Chinese regulations for international schools, WAB primarily accepts expatriate families. Applicants must hold a foreign (non-PRC) passport or have appropriate international status to enroll (with few exceptions). This is because local law reserves schools like WAB for foreign passport-holders. WAB’s mission, however, is inclusivity within that mandate – the school welcomes all nationalities, races, and religions among eligible students. (Indeed, no nationality dominates: currently ~45 percent of students are from North America/Oceania, ~36 percent from Asia, ~17 percent from Europe, and a few percent from elsewhere, with no single nationality >20 percent of the student body.)
•	Admissions Philosophy: WAB tries to ensure each admitted student will flourish in its program. The Admissions Committee looks for students who can access the curriculum (academically) and whose families embrace WAB’s values of diversity, inquiry, and community. Because WAB has support services, having varying academic levels or English levels is fine – the key is that the student shows potential and a positive attitude toward learning. WAB does not discriminate; it values a mix of backgrounds and talents. They also monitor enrollment to maintain a healthy balance of nationalities and languages (diversity is seen as a strength in classrooms).
•	Inquiry and Tour: The first step for prospective families is often an inquiry. The Admissions Office encourages families to fill out an online inquiry form (via OpenApply, WAB’s admissions portal) or contact the school with questions. The friendly Admissions team often arranges campus tours (in-person if the family is in Beijing, or virtual tours for those abroad) and informational meetings. This helps families understand WAB’s programs and community before formally applying.
•	Application Process: To apply, families create an account on OpenApply and complete WAB’s online application form for each child. The form collects personal details, educational history, and includes short-answer questions (older students may write a brief personal statement about their interests and why they want to attend WAB). An application fee of RMB ¥2,100 is required when submitting the application (this fee is non-refundable, covering administrative processing). There is no formal entrance exam, but WAB requires a set of supporting documents for a complete application file:
•	School Records: Report cards or transcripts from the current school and previous two years (where applicable) – to review the student’s academic progress.
•	Recommendations: Confidential teacher recommendations are requested. For example, a current teacher and/or counselor may need to fill out a form or write a letter. (WAB coordinates directly with the current school if needed, to ensure candid feedback.)
•	Student & Parent Statements: For older applicants (usually Grade 6 and up), WAB asks the student to write a short essay or statement about themselves, and parents to write about the child (strengths, challenges, reasons for choosing WAB). These help WAB get to know the applicant beyond grades.
•	Passport/Visa: A copy of the student’s passport (and Chinese visa or residency permit if already in China), as well as a passport copy for at least one parent (to verify expatriate status).
•	Additional Documentation: If the student has any special learning needs or has had educational/psychological assessments, those reports should be provided. This lets WAB evaluate if they can offer the necessary support. Similarly, if the student is not a native English speaker, any English proficiency test results can be submitted (though WAB can also assess English during the process).
•	Admissions Review Process: Once all application materials are submitted, WAB’s Admissions Committee conducts a thorough, holistic review. The committee typically includes admissions officers and relevant academic staff (e.g. the Principals or counselors of the division the student would enter). The process usually involves several steps:
1.	File Review: The team verifies that all documents are in order and looks over the student’s academic records and recommendations. They check basic eligibility (age appropriate for the grade, expat status, etc.) and gauge the student’s academic readiness and learning attitude from reports.
2.	Interview/Family Meeting: Most applicants and their families are invited for an interview or a visit (in person if possible, or via video call for overseas applicants). This is a friendly conversation – for younger children, it might be a play-based observation or a casual chat during a school visit; for older students, a more formal interview with questions about their interests, strengths, and understanding of WAB. Parents often meet with admissions staff as well. The school uses this meeting to understand the child’s personality and English level in a real setting, and to ensure the family understands WAB’s philosophy. It’s also an opportunity for families to ask detailed questions.
3.	Student Assessments: WAB may conduct some placement or diagnostic assessments, depending on grade level and background. For example, English language assessments are common – if a student’s first language isn’t English or they haven’t been in an English-speaking school, they might be asked to do an English reading/writing exercise or a test like the WIDA/MAP (for older students) to evaluate their English proficiency. This isn’t about “passing” or “failing,” but to determine what level of EAL support might be needed. In some cases (especially for middle/high school), WAB might also assess math skills or other core subject knowledge, particularly if there’s something unclear in the transcripts. And for very young children (ECC/KG), a playgroup observation might double as an assessment of developmental milestones (the child might be invited to join a class for an hour so teachers can see how they interact).
4.	Criteria for Acceptance: The committee looks for a good fit. Academically, can the student access WAB’s program (with support if needed)? If a student has significant learning needs, does WAB have the resources to accommodate them? Socially, will the student and family embrace WAB’s values of collaboration and diversity? WAB also ensures they have space in the particular grade (some grades or programs may have wait pools if full).
5.	Admissions Decision: After review, the school makes a decision. There are a few possible outcomes: Offer of Admission (the student is accepted unconditionally), Conditional Admission (accepted, but with certain conditions such as requiring extra support or language tutoring — conditions are clearly specified), Waitpool (the student is qualified, but no seat is currently available; the student is put in a waiting pool and may be offered a spot if one opens up), or Denial (if WAB feels it’s not a suitable match, which is relatively rare and usually due to capacity or support limitations). Decisions are communicated to families, typically within a couple of weeks after the interview/assessment stage.
•	Mid-Year Admissions: Because many expat families move at various times, WAB offers rolling admissions – students can be admitted throughout the year if space permits. There is no strict application season; however, most new students join at the start of a semester. If a student joins mid-year, tuition is prorated for the time they will attend (after the first quarter, WAB reduces the tuition by roughly 10 percent per month of school missed – so a student starting in November might pay ~60 percent of the annual tuition). The admissions and finance offices handle these cases individually. WAB also has experience integrating students mid-year – the academic teams and counselors pay special attention to helping late arrivals catch up academically and socially. For instance, teachers may arrange peer buddies or extra help sessions for a new student who enters part-way through a course.
•	Orientation for New Families: WAB prides itself on a warm welcome. Once a student is admitted and enrolled, the school’s Admissions and Parent Link teams help the family transition. New students are paired with a buddy student in their class when they start, to show them around and introduce them to classmates. There is a comprehensive New Family Orientation at the beginning of each semester: new parents attend info sessions to learn about school routines, technology platforms, and meet key staff; new students often have orientation activities and campus tours. WAB’s Parent Link association also assigns a “welcome ambassador” parent to each new family (often someone from the same country or who speaks the same language, if possible), so parents have a go-to contact for any questions about settling in Beijing or at WAB. By the time the student officially starts classes, they typically already feel they have friends and know some teachers, making the transition much easier.
•	Admissions Policies: WAB publishes clear admissions guidelines on its website. Notably, financial ability must be demonstrated (since WAB doesn’t have a formal financial aid program, families need to show they can pay the fees, often via a company sponsorship letter or bank statement, especially if needing visa documentation). Upon accepting an offer, families sign an Admissions Agreement and pay a deposit (see Tuition section). WAB’s admissions process is conducted in English (with translation help if needed) and is very transparent – the school values honesty and will openly discuss any concerns or questions families have during the process. The overall goal is to ensure a smooth, informed, and positive start to the family’s WAB journey.
