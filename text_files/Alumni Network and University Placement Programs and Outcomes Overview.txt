  •	Alumni Network Overview: Since opening in 1994, WAB has graduated thousands of students from dozens of countries. These alumni are spread across North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. WAB’s philosophy is “Once a WAB Tiger, always a WAB Tiger” – meaning alumni remain part of the community. The school has an Alumni Office with a full-time Alumni Relations Coordinator who keeps in touch with former students, parents, and even former staff. Uniquely, anyone who attended WAB (even for a short time) is considered part of the alumni family, not just those who completed Grade 12. Alumni also include former teachers and administrators. This inclusive approach recognizes the transient nature of international schools and values every member of the community.
  •	Staying Connected: WAB maintains an alumni database and encourages alumni to update their contact info. They publish the “Tiger’s Pride” alumni e-newsletter, which shares updates about the school, alumni achievements, reunions, and messages from the Head of School. There are active alumni groups on social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) where news and job/networking opportunities are shared. In 2024, as WAB turned 30, the school launched an official WAB Alumni Association with regional chapters. Alumni volunteers in cities like New York, London, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc., act as ambassadors who help organize meet-ups and welcome new alumni in those areas.
  •	Alumni Events: Regular reunions and gatherings are a big part of alumni engagement. In Beijing, WAB hosts an annual Alumni Reunion (often around Chinese New Year or the school’s anniversary) where dozens of graduates from different years come together on campus – some timing visits to Beijing just to attend. When school leadership or counselors travel overseas for work or conferences, they often arrange alumni meet-ups in those destinations. For example, WAB has in recent years held alumni dinners in New York City, London, Vancouver, Seoul, and Sydney whenever there’s a critical mass of alumni and a staff member visiting. These events help alumni reconnect with each other and with WAB, and can create professional networking opportunities too.
  •	On-Campus Involvement: Alumni are always welcome back on campus (with prior registration for security). Many alumni visit when they’re in Beijing to say hello to teachers or tour new facilities. WAB even has an online Alumni Visit Registration form to streamline this. Furthermore, alumni frequently return in official capacities: it’s common for recent grads (university students) to come back over winter break to join a University Alumni Panel speaking to current seniors about college life. Other alumni have given talks at assemblies or events – e.g., an alum working at Microsoft might speak during a technology conference at WAB, or alumni entrepreneurs might mentor students in the business incubator club. WAB actively invites alumni to be mentors or guest speakers, tapping into their expertise to enrich current students’ learning.
  •	Alumni Mentorship & Networking: The school fosters a spirit of alumni helping each other and current students. Older alumni often mentor younger ones in university or early career. For instance, an alum at Harvard might guide a recent WAB grad who’s a freshman there, or a WAB alum working in finance might offer an internship to a college-age alum. WAB’s alumni office facilitates these connections where possible. There are also informal networks: country-specific WAB alumni WeChat groups for those in China, or industry-specific LinkedIn groups. The idea is that no matter where life takes them, WAB alumni have a global family to reach out to.
  •	Recognition and Pride: To strengthen alumni identity, WAB introduced Alumni Awards in recent years. For example, they have an Alumni Service Award to honor alumni who significantly give back to WAB or society, and possibly an Alumni Achievement Award for notable career or community accomplishments. These are awarded at events and featured in newsletters, inspiring both alumni and current students. During the 30th anniversary, WAB ran a campaign called “30 Alumni for 30 Years,” spotlighting 30 alumni stories across different fields to celebrate the diverse paths WAB graduates have taken and how they embody the school’s values. This kind of recognition builds pride among alumni and shows current students the legacy they will be joining.
  •	College Counseling at WAB: Shifting to university placements – WAB has a robust College Counseling department devoted to guiding high school students to the next step. There are multiple experienced college counselors who begin working with students in Grade 10/11. They help students discover best-fit universities, navigate application requirements, brainstorm and edit essays, arrange teacher recommendation letters, and prepare for interviews if needed. They also organize University Info Sessions for parents and students (often 30+ such events per year), where they might have panels of alumni or guest admissions officers to demystify processes. WAB hosts many university visits – each year, representatives from dozens of colleges worldwide visit WAB to meet students. Notably, WAB limits the number of applications a student can make (usually around 10–12 universities max, not counting multiple University of California campuses as separate). This policy encourages students to focus on quality applications to genuinely suitable schools rather than chasing a high number of applications. The result is less stress and very strong outcomes, as described next.
  •	University Matriculation: Virtually all WAB graduates who apply to university secure admission somewhere, and the vast majority attend university immediately after graduation. (A few might take gap years or have mandatory military service, but higher education enrollment is nearly 100 percent.) WAB graduates attend a wide range of universities across the world – fitting for such an international student body. WAB emphasizes “finding the right fit” for each student, rather than everyone aiming for a narrow definition of success, but the outcomes are objectively impressive. Here’s a breakdown by region, using the Class of 2024 (79 students) and recent years as examples of where WAB students go:
  •	United States & Canada: About half of WAB graduates choose North America for university. WAB alumni have gained admission to all 8 Ivy League universities over the years. Recent classes have had multiple Ivies represented. For instance, the Class of 2024 had students admitted to Columbia (3 students), Brown (2), University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, Yale, etc. In addition, WAB grads attend other top U.S. schools like Stanford, MIT, Duke, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, and so on. Prestigious public universities are popular too: every year some choose UC Berkeley, UCLA, and University of Michigan (WAB’s curriculum qualifies it as a California “Eligibility in the Local Context” school for UC admissions). For Canada, common destinations include University of Toronto (the Class of 2024 garnered 17 offers from U of T), University of British Columbia (UBC – 11 offers in Class of 2024), McGill University, University of Waterloo, McMaster, etc. Typically 10–15 percent of the class heads to Canada. Canadian universities value the IB, and WAB students often earn scholarships or advanced credit due to their IB scores.
  •	United Kingdom: The UK is chosen by roughly 10–15 percent of WAB graduates in recent years. WAB students have an excellent record with Oxford and Cambridge – almost every year there is at least one Oxbridge success (in Class of 2024, one student went to Oxford and one to Cambridge). Many attend London-based elite universities: Imperial College London, King’s College London, University College London (UCL) are frequent destinations (e.g., Class of 2024: Imperial 3 admits, King’s 4, UCL 2). Additionally, WAB grads go to other Russell Group universities such as University of Edinburgh, University of Bath, University of Warwick, University of Manchester, Durham University etc., depending on their interests. A few pursue more specialized UK institutions – for instance, some have attended Royal College of Music (for the arts) or Arts University Bournemouth (for film/animation). The IB Diploma is well-recognized in the UK system, and WAB’s above-average IB results mean students often meet or exceed the point requirements of their offers.
  •	Asia & Oceania: An increasing number of students choose universities in Asia (outside China) or Oceania. In Hong Kong, popular choices include University of Hong Kong (HKU) and HKUST, which offer world-class programs in English (some WAB students who want to be closer to home or leverage bilingual skills choose HK universities). A few students, especially those with Chinese citizenship who are eligible, have matriculated to top Mainland Chinese universities like Peking University or Tsinghua University, often through special foreign student programs or after a gap year of language study. South Korea: WAB’s Korean graduates often gain admission to the prestigious SKY universities – notably Seoul National University (SNU), as well as Yonsei and Korea University. Impressively, as of 2024, at least 7 students from the graduating class were admitted to SNU (a testament to WAB’s rigorous academics and bilingual environment giving them an edge). Japan: Some students choose Japan’s English-language university programs; WAB alumni have attended Keio University, Waseda University, International Christian University (ICU), Sophia University, etc., especially those who are Japanese returnees or interested in Japan. Singapore: A few have gone to National University of Singapore (NUS) or other Singaporean universities, given their high global ranking. Australia/NZ: Each year a handful of students (often Australian/Kiwi expatriates) attend universities in Australia or New Zealand. Common picks are University of Melbourne, Australian National University (ANU), University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, and University of Auckland. The IB is well-accepted there, and some WAB grads like the idea of going to universities in the Asia-Pacific region.
  •	Continental Europe & Other: Some graduates (especially those from Europe) return to their home countries or go elsewhere in Europe. WAB grads have attended schools like Erasmus University Rotterdam and University of Amsterdam (Netherlands), Leiden University College (Netherlands), Lund University (Sweden), various business schools in Spain (ESADE, IE), Sciences Po (France), and universities in Switzerland, Germany, etc. A few pursue unique paths like culinary school, art/design colleges (one alum went to Rhode Island School of Design in the US, another to Parsons Paris), or other specialized institutions. WAB’s counseling office is equipped to support applications to virtually any country – they’ve handled apps to places like India, Middle East, or South Africa when needed.
  •	University Application Success: Typically, WAB seniors receive multiple offers and can choose between excellent options. The college counseling team’s individualized approach ensures each student finds a good match. The result is that each graduating class not only has many admissions to top-ranked universities, but also each student ends up at a place aligned with their interests and goals. WAB does not measure success purely by rankings, but it’s noteworthy that graduates attend many of the world’s top 50 universities annually. Importantly, WAB alumni tend to thrive in university – colleges often feedback that WAB students are well-prepared, creative, globally minded, and stand out as leaders on campus. This is attributed to their IB background, their independence fostered at WAB, and their rich extracurricular profiles.
  •	Academic Results: Part of what underpins those college outcomes is strong academic performance at WAB. The IB Diploma pass rate at WAB is near 100 percent most years. As mentioned, the average IB score is ~33 points, significantly above the world average ~30. For context, WAB’s top scorers often achieve 40+ points (out of 45), and a number of students earn bilingual diplomas. WAB students also historically do well in standardized tests when they choose to take them (SAT/ACT averages for WAB are well above US averages, though many students rely primarily on IB scores and don’t all take SAT). These academic markers give universities confidence in WAB applicants.
  •	Alumni Trajectories: After university, WAB alumni venture into every field imaginable – reflecting the school’s well-rounded preparation. Some highlights: alumni have started their own companies and NGOs (entrepreneurial spirit often credited back to those PYP Exhibitions or CAS projects that planted the seed), many have earned advanced degrees (WAB alumni have gone on to grad schools like Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, etc.), and some have made marks in arts and sports (e.g., an alumna in fashion design featured in a Vogue article on inclusive fashion, another alum won an engineering award at Stanford, a few have played sports semi-professionally). Teachers love when alumni visit and say that their time at WAB – the curiosity, confidence, and international mindset it instilled – was key to their later success. Additionally, numerous WAB alumni eventually end up in international careers or even return to Beijing; a handful have even come back to WAB as teachers or staff, which is the ultimate full-circle testimony.
  •	Giving Back: A strong indicator of alumni connection is their willingness to give back. WAB alumni and alumni parents contribute to the school in various ways: some donate to scholarship or improvement funds (when those exist for specific projects), many offer to mentor or speak to current students, and they help broaden WAB’s network globally. As WAB is a relatively young school (compared to say a 100-year-old institution), its alumni network is growing rapidly in influence. Each year that passes creates more alumni who are making a difference around the world, enhancing WAB’s reputation in turn. The school often mentions alumni to current students as inspiration, and alumni often say, “WAB will always be home.”

In summary, WAB’s alumni network and university placements are a source of great pride. Students graduate WAB not only with an accredited diploma and (often) an IB Diploma, but with the skills, character, and global outlook to excel in higher education and beyond. They attend some of the world’s most selective universities yet remain connected to their roots at WAB. The phrase that resonates is truly “Once a WAB Tiger, always a WAB Tiger” – the support and community do not end at graduation, it simply expands worldwide.
