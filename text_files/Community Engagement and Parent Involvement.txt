  •	Parent Link (Parent Association): All parents and guardians of WAB students are automatically members of Parent Link, which is WAB’s parent-teacher association. Parent Link’s mission is “to make a difference by connecting, supporting, and enriching our community in a spirit of shared enthusiasm and positive action.” This volunteer-run organization is a vital bridge between home and school, organizing events, providing feedback to school leadership, and facilitating parent involvement. Key functions of Parent Link include:
  •	Communication & Welcome: Parent Link helps onboard new families and keep current parents informed. They host regular coffee mornings with the Head of School or Principals, publish newsletters/WeChat updates with school news, and maintain an active presence to answer parent questions. For example, if the school rolls out a new curriculum change, Parent Link may organize an info Q&A session with administrators. They also run a “Welcome Ambassador” program (matching newcomer families with experienced parent mentors) to ensure everyone feels included.
  •	Volunteer Coordination: Parent Link mobilizes parents to volunteer in various capacities. This could be as simple as reading to children on Literacy Day, helping supervise field trip groups, or chaperoning at school dances. They also coordinate class parents or grade-level reps who assist teachers with events and help build community among families of a class.
  •	Events and Fundraisers: Parent Link spearheads many beloved school-wide events that build community spirit: for instance, the annual Fun Fair (a big spring carnival open to all WAB families, featuring games, international food booths, student performances, and raffle prizes) and a Winter Charity Bazaar/Community Market (around December, where families and local vendors set up stalls, raising money for charity and celebrating global cultures). These events draw huge attendance (the Fun Fair often attracts thousands of people) and are a highlight of the year. Parent Link also assists with school events like International Day, teacher appreciation events, and more.
  •	Tiger Spirit & Support: Within Parent Link, committees like Tiger Spirit Link coordinate with student sports teams and arts performances – e.g., organizing parent volunteers to provide snacks, decorations, and cheering sections during tournaments or school plays. They make banners, arrange carpools for local games, and ensure our “WAB Tigers” feel supported. Another committee, Charity Link, focuses on service – often working with student clubs on charitable drives (like collecting donations for disaster relief or organizing service trips to local orphanages). In WAB’s 30th anniversary year (2024), Parent Link’s Charity group teamed up with student leaders to host a city-wide charity run that raised funds for a local cause and showcased WAB’s community spirit to the larger Beijing expat community.
  •	Friends of the Library: This sub-group of Parent Link encourages literacy and love of reading. Parent volunteers run book swaps, help staff the annual Book Week events, organize “pajama story nights” for elementary kids, and assist librarians with covering new books. Their efforts enhance library programs and model a parent-student reading culture.
  •	Parent Interest Groups: Parent Link also runs activities for parents themselves to bond and learn. Through Community Link, they organize outings like Beijing city tours (great for newcomers to learn about local culture), parent fitness classes on campus, and workshops (e.g. Chinese painting class, cooking classes featuring different cuisines). These activities help parents network and enjoy the WAB experience alongside their kids.
  •	School Store (Tiger Den): Parent Link operates a small shop on campus called the “Tiger Den,” selling WAB spirit wear (t-shirts, hoodies, etc.), school memorabilia, and basic school supplies. It’s staffed by parent volunteers. Profits from the store go back into funding Parent Link initiatives or donations for school improvements. It’s also a social spot – parents might drop in to chat and buy the latest WAB t-shirt on assembly days.
  •	Parents as Learners: WAB believes in educating the whole community, and Parent Link supports this by hosting parent education workshops. Typically, WAB (often via Parent Link coordination) offers 30+ parent workshops annually on topics ranging from “Understanding the IB Curriculum” and “College Admissions 101” to “Parenting in the Digital Age” or “Supporting Your Third Culture Kid.” These sessions, led by WAB staff or outside experts, are very popular and help parents better support their children and also continue their own learning.
  •	Overall Impact: Parent Link’s contributions create a warm, inclusive atmosphere. It’s often said that WAB feels like a “big family”, and much of that is due to the active parent community. Parents at WAB give generously of their “time, talent, and treasure” – volunteering countless hours, sharing professional expertise with students (like career talks), and fundraising for school enhancements. In 2024, Parent Link gifted a bronze tiger statue to the school for its anniversary, symbolizing the strength of the WAB family. The partnership between parents and school is truly collaborative; school leadership meets regularly with Parent Link to listen to parent feedback and ideas. New families often comment on how welcomed they felt, thanks in large part to Parent Link.
  •	Student and Community Service: WAB’s ethos of “making a difference” extends to many service initiatives that involve the whole community. Students from elementary onward participate in charitable projects (sometimes with parent support). For example, student clubs might organize a clothing drive for local migrant children; Parent Link’s Charity committee might help facilitate and provide logistics. The school hosts an annual Charity Bazaar where student, parent, and staff groups run stalls selling food or crafts to raise funds for charities. These activities cultivate empathy and reinforce WAB’s commitment to being responsible global citizens. It’s common to see families working together at these events, whether it’s a parent-child team managing a booth or collecting donations for disaster relief.
  •	School Spirit and Traditions: WAB has developed many special traditions that strengthen its community. For instance, each year High School seniors go on a Graduation Trip together and have a fun “Senior Prank Day” (in good taste) that the whole school anticipates. The culmination of a WAB education is the Graduation Ceremony, often held on campus under a big tent by WAB’s picturesque Duck Lake – a memorable event where the whole community (teachers, parents, underclassmen) celebrates the seniors. It’s tradition to have an alumni speaker or a teacher who’s been at WAB for a long time give a speech, highlighting the bonds formed at WAB. Events like these are community-wide celebrations, not just for the students involved. Another cherished event is International Day, where families set up tables to represent dozens of countries with food and cultural displays – everyone wears national costumes and the diversity of WAB truly shines. Spirit Week, Sports Day, and the annual Fun Fair (carnival) also bring together students, staff, and parents in festive, school-spirited ways. These traditions become part of the collective memory of WAB families, creating an emotional attachment to the school.
In sum, the involvement of parents and the broader community is a pillar of WAB’s success. Students benefit from the rich network of support, and parents feel deeply connected to the school. This synergy creates a nurturing environment and is frequently cited as one of WAB’s greatest strengths (the so-called “WAB family” feel).
