•	Environment: The ECC provides a warm, joyful introduction to school in a purpose-built early years facility. Classrooms are safe, bright, and filled with hands-on materials. There are dedicated indoor and outdoor play areas (including an ECC playground and gardens) designed for young children. Mixed-age classes (3 and 4-year-olds together) allow older children to mentor younger ones, and younger kids to learn from older peers, fostering a family-like atmosphere.
•	Reggio Emilia-Inspired Learning: The ECC curriculum is play-based and child-centered, drawing from Reggio Emilia principles. Teachers view children as capable, curious learners. Activities often emerge from the children’s own interests and questions. Creativity, exploration, and “learning through play” are emphasized every day.
•	IB PYP Integration: Even at age 3–4, learning aligns with the Primary Years Programme framework. Children explore developmentally appropriate versions of the IB “Units of Inquiry” – broad themes like “Who We Are” or “How the World Works”. Through play and stories, they begin investigating big ideas and building foundational skills. Social-emotional learning is central: kids practice sharing, problem-solving, and expressing themselves.
•	Schedule and Support: A typical ECC day might include outdoor play, morning circle time, learning centers (art, blocks, sensory play, reading), snack and rest time, and specialist lessons (e.g. music or library). The schedule is flexible to meet young children’s needs, and families can opt for half-day programs if needed. Low student-teacher ratios (small class sizes with assistant teachers) ensure each child gets personal attention and care. Teachers partner closely with parents to support each child’s transition to school.
