•	WAB’s outdoor program, “WAB Wild,” takes learning into nature with a strong environmental focus. Activities are grade-specific and build independence: students learn Leave-No-Trace principles, navigation, and survival skills in progressively challenging expeditions.
•	Students engage in multi-day expeditions (by land and water) and interdisciplinary outdoor classrooms in subjects like science and geography.
•	Skills taught include rock-climbing, abseiling, kayaking, canoeing, radio communication, and rescue training.
•	The Miao Liang Environmental Education Center in the Mi Yun mountains (on Bai He River) hosts programs for Grades 6–12, including environmental science, team-building, and sustainability studies.
•	The center models ecological living: solar power, composting toilets, biogas digesters, and greywater systems.
•	Grade 5 students attend a transition camp focused on team-building, preparing them socially and emotionally for middle school.
•	Middle schoolers learn outdoor safety and camping to foster a lifelong love of nature.
•	High schoolers can participate in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Adventurous Journey, planning and executing self-sufficient expeditions that test leadership, teamwork, and resilience.
