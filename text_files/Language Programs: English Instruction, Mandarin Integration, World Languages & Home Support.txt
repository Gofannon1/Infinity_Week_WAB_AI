•	Language of Instruction (English): The primary language of instruction for all academic subjects is English. WAB is an English-medium environment – students are expected to either have strong English proficiency or develop it rapidly. English as an Additional Language (EAL) support is provided at all grade levels to help non-native speakers build academic English. Many teachers have expertise in teaching multilingual learners. WAB’s goal is for all students to thrive in English, while also valuing their mother tongues.
•	Host Country Language (Chinese Mandarin): Given its location in China, WAB integrates Mandarin Chinese language and cultural studies from Early Childhood through Grade 12. In the Elementary School, all students have Mandarin classes several times a week, with instruction differentiated into multiple levels (from absolute beginner to native-speaker level). In Middle School and High School, Chinese is offered at various levels as part of the IB curriculum: students can take Mandarin Chinese as a Language A (literature, for native/near-native speakers) or as a Language B/ab initio (language acquisition for non-native learners) in both the MYP and DP. Many long-term WAB students graduate bilingual in English and Chinese or at least with strong Mandarin skills – a valuable asset for living in China and a hallmark of WAB’s commitment to global citizenship.
•	Other World Languages: Starting in Grade 6, students may opt to study an additional language besides Chinese. WAB offers Spanish and French as world language options. In the MYP (Grades 6–10), these are offered as Language Acquisition courses for beginners or intermediate learners. In the IB Diploma Programme, WAB typically offers Spanish B (SL/HL), Spanish ab initio (SL), and French B (SL/HL) as courses for Grades 11–12. These classes are quite popular, and some students even choose to study two foreign languages in DP (for example, Chinese A + French B). Latin or other languages are not part of the formal curriculum; however, if there is interest, students have started clubs for other languages (for instance, a Korean language club has existed for self-motivated learners).
•	Home Language Support: WAB is notable for supporting students’ mother tongues through after-school Home Language Programs. In coordination with parents and community volunteers, WAB helps facilitate language classes or clubs in students’ native languages. For example, there have been parent-organized groups for Dutch, German (outside of SSB), Finnish, Swedish, Korean, and other languages. Native-speaking parents or teachers lead sessions where students from those backgrounds can read, write, and speak in their home language on campus after school. This ensures students maintain their mother tongue literacy and cultural connection while attending WAB. It also celebrates linguistic diversity within the school. (WAB often says it wants students to gain a new language without losing their first.)
