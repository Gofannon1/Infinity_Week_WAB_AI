•	Arts (Visual & Performing): The Arts are a cornerstone of WAB’s identity. Students engage in music, drama, dance, visual arts, and film through both curriculum and extracurriculars. Music: There are choirs, orchestras, and bands for various ages and skill levels. For example, elementary has beginner ensembles; secondary students can join Concert Band, Jazz Band, rock bands, etc. WAB hosts many concerts and showcases (including the popular “Rock in the Park” festival featuring student bands). Top student musicians audition for inter-school honor groups – WAB regularly sends students to APAC Music festivals and the ISCMS Honor Orchestra/Choir, collaborating with talented peers from other international schools. Theater & Dance: Each division produces annual productions (plays or musicals). Students participate not just as actors, but also in backstage roles like set design, lighting, and sound – learning the full theater production process. WAB High School puts on a big musical or play every year that often rivals professional productions in quality (leveraging the school’s excellent theaters and tech). WAB is an APAC Arts school, meaning theater, dance, and music ensembles travel to festivals to perform with schools across Asia. These experiences build confidence and creativity. Visual Arts & Film: Budding artists have numerous outlets. In class, students create paintings, sculptures, ceramics (there’s a kiln on campus), digital art, and more. After school, there are art clubs for those who want extra studio time or to explore photography, fashion design, etc. Student artwork is displayed throughout campus and in exhibitions (the school holds art shows and an IB Art Exhibition annually). The High School runs the WAB Identity Film Festival, showcasing student-produced films to the community. There’s also a Tiger TV/Media club where students produce video news and live-stream school events (gaining real media production experience). Recognition: WAB’s arts program is award-winning – in 2025, WAB received a national “Arts & Creativity Award” from the British Chamber of Commerce in China, recognizing its outstanding commitment to arts education.
•	Sports & Athletics: WAB’s sports program is both inclusive (everyone can join) and competitive (teams excel in high-level competitions). There are opportunities from the youngest grades (early elementary sports days and clubs) up to varsity teams in high school. WAB offers 16+ different sports, including soccer (football), basketball, volleyball, badminton, tennis, table tennis, rugby, swimming, track & field, cross-country, baseball/softball, and more. The school typically has three seasons of sports, allowing students to try multiple sports throughout the year. At high school, teams are organized into junior varsity and varsity levels to cater to different developmental stages. Committed athletes (like the Tigersharks swim squad) train year-round and some go on to compete at collegiate levels. WAB teams compete in a robust international circuit: as mentioned, WAB is a member of APAC for major sports (competing against top international schools from across Asia-Pacific), ACAMIS for regional tournaments, and ISAC/China Cup locally. Students travel to tournaments in other cities/countries, which is a highlight of the athletic experience. The emphasis is on sportsmanship, teamwork, and personal growth. While WAB does produce championship-winning teams and even sports scholarship recipients (alumni have played sports for universities like NYU, McGill, Brown, etc.), the program equally welcomes beginners. Many sports have no-cut policies at younger levels, ensuring any student can participate, learn the sport, and be part of a team. Facilities & Spirit: WAB’s top-notch athletic facilities (see Campus section) include multiple gyms, a climbing wall, a 25m indoor pool, outdoor fields with artificial turf, tennis courts, and the inflatable Tiger L’Air Dome for all-weather practice. These contribute to quality training and play. School spirit at games is bolstered by the Parent Link Tiger Spirit committee and enthusiastic fans. In 2025, WAB hosted the APAC Badminton tournament on campus, which coincided with a big community Night Market festival – showcasing how sports and school community go hand-in-hand.
•	Clubs and Activities: Beyond arts and sports, WAB offers a tremendous variety of clubs for all sorts of interests – academic enrichment, STEM, culture, service, leadership, and just-for-fun hobbies. In total, there are hundreds of activities (in high school alone there are usually 50–100 active clubs any given year). Some examples include: Student Government (leadership and event planning), Model United Nations and Debate Team (for those interested in politics and public speaking), STEMx Club (science and engineering projects), Robotics/Coding clubs, entrepreneurship programs like the Tiger Den Incubator (which supports student startups and business pitch competitions), Global Changemakers Club (partnering with NGOs on service and sustainability projects), environmental action groups, cooking and culinary clubs, language and culture clubs (French Club, Korean Club, etc.), strategy game clubs, and much more. For younger students in elementary, WAB runs after-school ASA (After School Activities) seasons where kids can try mini-courses in art, science experiments, sports, or dance – building interest and skills in a fun setting. A unique elementary tradition is the “Olympic Dream Series” – a lunch-time athletics series for Grades 2–5 where students participate in various track-and-field style events throughout the year, promoting wide participation and team spirit.
•	Notable Initiatives: WAB is known for some especially innovative student-led initiatives, which often start as clubs and become part of school culture. For instance, the Tiger Den Incubator (mentioned above) functions like a startup accelerator: students develop business ideas, and local entrepreneurs/parents mentor them; some student businesses have even raised funds for charity or become ongoing enterprises. The WAB Podcast Club produces a regular podcast featuring student discussions, interviews with faculty/alumni, and insights into campus life – giving students a voice and honing media skills. The Human Library Project invites community members to school as “living books” so students can hear diverse personal stories firsthand (promoting empathy and understanding). In 2025, students launched an AI & Ethics Lab, exploring emerging technologies (like AI, machine learning) through the lens of ethics, philosophy, and coding – reflecting WAB’s leadership in integrating new ideas into co-curriculars. These examples show that if a student has an interest, WAB likely has a platform for it; and if not, students are encouraged to start a new club. Faculty advisors and Parent Link often support these clubs, but many are truly student-driven.
•	Overall Student Life: Life at WAB is rich and multi-dimensional. The breadth of co-curricular options means students can be athletes, artists, scholars, and leaders all at once. It’s common to see a student perform in a music concert, compete in a volleyball match, and volunteer in a charity drive all in the same month. WAB believes this balanced development produces well-rounded individuals. Participation is celebrated – whether a student is the star of the basketball team or a backstage crew member in a play, each role is valued. This inclusive approach in co-curriculars boosts school spirit and a sense of belonging. Students often discover lifelong passions through WABX programs, and learn important life skills like time management, leadership, and teamwork along the way.
