•	Mission Statement: “Connect, Inspire, Challenge: Make a Difference.” This concise motto guides all aspects of school life – connecting people and ideas, inspiring a love of learning, challenging individuals to grow, and encouraging everyone to make a positive difference.
•	Core Philosophy: Educating the whole child, supporting professional excellence in staff, and partnering with parents. These principles ensure focus on academics and well-being, and strong community engagement.
•	Core Values (The WAB “DNA”): WAB has five key values that shape its culture and programs:
•	Life-Long Learning: Everyone in the WAB community is a continuous learner, fostering inquiry, critical thinking, and a growth mindset. Every decision aims to enhance this life-long learning process.
•	WAB Spirit – “gong he” (工合): Emphasis on working hard and working together. This spirit of joyful collaboration and shared purpose means individuals unite their energy for the common good. “Gong he” captures the idea of collective effort and commitment.
•	Community & Responsibility: Mutual respect and care for each other and the environment. WAB nurtures healthy relationships and instills responsibility to self, family, community, and the world. Students learn to value service and environmental stewardship as part of their education.
•	Mosaic of Diversity: The WAB community is a mosaic where each unique individual contributes to a vibrant whole. The school celebrates diversity – symbolized by the five colors in WAB’s mission logo (representing five continents and the inclusion of all). With 50+ nationalities and no dominant group, WAB truly embodies a multicultural “family.”
•	Global Citizenship in a Chinese Context: WAB cultivates socially responsible global citizens, all within the context of host country China. The Chinese character for “learning” (学 xué) lies at the center of WAB’s logo – signifying that China ties together the diverse WAB family. Students learn to be globally minded while respecting and engaging with Chinese culture and society.
•	Mission in Action: These values aren’t just words on paper – they inform daily teaching, curriculum design, and school decisions. Connect (融合 rónghé) emphasizes building relationships and interdisciplinary links. Inspire (激发 jīfā) focuses on sparking curiosity and creativity in an enriching environment. Challenge (挑战 tiǎozhàn) means everyone is pushed to excel and to question assumptions. Make a Difference (贡献 gòngxiàn) is a call to action for all community members to have a positive impact. Under this mission-driven culture, WAB strives to be a place where excellence and inclusiveness thrive together – a top-tier school that is also warm and welcoming.
