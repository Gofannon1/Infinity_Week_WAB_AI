•	Learning Support Services: WAB has Learning Support (LS) teachers/special educators in each division (Elementary, Middle, High) to assist students with mild to moderate learning needs. Support is tailored through individualized plans and can include in-class co-teaching support, small-group or pull-out sessions, and assistive technology. For example, if a student has diagnosed learning differences (mild ADHD, dyslexia, etc.), the LS team works with classroom teachers to provide accommodations or specialized instruction. WAB’s philosophy is that with the right support, most students can be included in mainstream classes. For students with higher needs, WAB offers an Enriched Inclusion Program – a more intensive support option (with additional staffing and fees) to accommodate certain students who might not be served at other international schools. This shows WAB’s commitment to going above and beyond in inclusion.
•	English as an Additional Language (EAL): As mentioned, dedicated EAL specialists help non-native English speakers. New students whose English is still developing may get periods of intensive English instruction or in-class language support. The goal is rapid language acquisition without isolating students – EAL teachers often co-teach in the regular classroom, so students learn English while staying on track in other subjects. Over time, most students exit the EAL program as they become proficient.
•	Counseling Services: School counselors are present in each school section (Elementary, Middle, High) to guide students’ social-emotional health and development. Counselors teach classroom lessons on topics like friendship skills, conflict resolution, mental health, and career/university planning (age-appropriate for each level). They are also available for one-on-one counseling when students need to talk through personal issues. In the highly transient expat context, counselors pay special attention to transitions – welcoming new students and supporting those who are leaving. WAB has programs to ease transitions, such as new student orientations and goodbye rituals, recognizing the emotional impact of moving schools frequently. In High School, college counselors focus on guiding students (and parents) through the university admissions process (detailed later).
•	Health and Well-Being Initiatives: WAB takes student well-being seriously. The school nurses in each division manage physical health and first aid, but well-being goes beyond that. In recent years, WAB has launched innovative initiatives like the “Yellow CAR” system – a simple check-in tool introduced in 2025 where students can discreetly signal their emotional state (Content, Anxious, or Relaxed, for example) using colored cards or an app, helping teachers and counselors identify who might need support on a given day. WAB also promotes mindfulness, stress management, and a healthy lifestyle through various programs. For instance, “wellness days” or workshops for students address topics such as coping with academic pressure, digital detox, etc. The overall environment is one where asking for help is encouraged; the ethos is that no student should feel alone.
•	Inclusive Ethos: WAB’s approach aligns with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child – every child has the right to education and inclusion. Students of different backgrounds and abilities learn alongside each other. Gifted students are offered extension opportunities (e.g. advanced courses, enrichment projects, mentorships) to keep them challenged, while students who struggle receive scaffolding. This inclusive classroom model benefits all students by fostering empathy and collaboration. WAB also involves outside specialists as needed (for example, consulting psychologists or therapists) if a student needs support beyond what the school can internally provide. Overall, WAB strives to balance academic excellence with care for each student’s emotional and social growth.
